# Challenge

In this challenge, we will looking at calculating a rolling average of a time series where events occur at non-uniform time intervals.

Included with this challenge are:
* **example.csv**, containing a sample set of data, with time column provided in seconds.
* **example.png**, an example output of the 10-minute rolling average data over time, plotted on top of the original un-averaged power.
* boiler plate code written in python, however, you are not under any obligation to use python.

Our ask is for you to write a function (or complete the boilerplate code) to calculate a rolling average. 

# Some notes:

* you can use any other external libraries that you like.
* since itâ€™s unclear what the value of the system is between the published time points, please specify any assumptions you make. For example, a good assumption might be that you simply assume the value stays unchanged until the next time point is published.
* you will be assessed on the performance, readability, and maintainability of your submission. 

please submit your code, and include 
* comments about how you came up with your solution
* how to run your solution (e.g. if there are any external dependencies), a readme might be a good idea.
* any images/outputs that shows the actual output from your solution.
* and anything else we might find useful in assessing your submission.

Good luck!
